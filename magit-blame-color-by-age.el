;;; Commentary:
;; Color magit-blame chunk headings by committer or author age.  Age
;; coloring is performed after the asynchronous magit-blame process
;; completes.  A "quickstart" run of visibile chunks occurs prior to
;; full completion; headings will receive further updates after this
;; initial run.  See the custom variables for a few configuration
;; options.
